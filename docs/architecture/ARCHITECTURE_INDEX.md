# Architecture Index
## Maatify Admin Infra

> **Authoritative Architecture Index — FINAL · LOCKED**

This document is the **single entry point** for all architectural decisions,
documents, and phases of **Maatify Admin Infra**.

Any implementation, extension, or future decision **MUST conform** to the
architecture defined and indexed here.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Library Name:** `maatify/admin-infra`  
**Type:** Admin Infrastructure Library

---

## 🧱 Architectural Phases Index

The architecture is defined across **progressive, locked phases**.
Each phase builds on the previous one and must not contradict it.

---

- Security toggles
- Feature flags
- Access control
- Audit of changes
- Fail-safe defaults

**Status:** FINAL · LOCKED

---

### ✅ Phase 7 — Sessions, Devices & Security

**File:**
```

docs/architecture/admin-sessions-security.md

```

**Covers:**
- Session lifecycle
- Device identification & trust
- Session revocation
- Impersonation
- Emergency security mode
- Notifications & audit integration

**Status:** FINAL · LOCKED

---

### ✅ Phase 8 — Operations, Exports & Observability

**File:**
```

docs/architecture/admin-ops-observability.md

```

**Covers:**
- Operational actions
- Async exports
- Secure delivery
- Logs, metrics & health
- Observability boundaries
- Permission enforcement

**Status:** FINAL · LOCKED

---

## 🔒 Global Locked Decisions (Summary)

- ❌ No admin deletion (hard or soft)
- ❌ No implicit permissions
- ❌ No external auth trust
- ❌ No OAuth-only admins
- ❌ No Telegram login or MFA
- ❌ No blocking side effects
- ❌ No framework dependency

- ✅ Internal TOTP enforced if enabled
- ✅ Audit is append-only
- ✅ Notifications are pluggable
- ✅ All privileged actions are auditable
- ✅ Emergency security controls exist

---

## 🧩 Cross-Cutting Architecture Rules

The following documents define **global architectural rules**
that apply to **all phases and all implementations**, regardless of execution order.

They do not represent execution phases and must not be bypassed.

---

### 🔒 Failure & Exception Model

**File:**
```

docs/architecture/admin-failure-and-exception-model.md

```

**Covers:**
- Authoritative failure semantics
- Exception usage boundaries
- Result DTO vs Exception rules
- Transport-agnostic error handling
- Ajax / UI / CLI / Callback compatibility
- Forbidden failure patterns

**Status:** FINAL · LOCKED · AUTHORITATIVE

This document is **mandatory** for:
- All contracts
- All repository interfaces
- All core orchestration logic
- All future implementations

Any violation invalidates the implementation.

---

## 🧾 Governance Rules

- Any new phase **must reference this index**
- Any contradiction invalidates the change
- Any exception requires explicit ADR
- No architectural decision lives outside this index
- Any implementation that violates the Failure & Exception Model is INVALID
---

## 🏁 Architecture Status

> ✅ **ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE · STABLE · LOCKED**

The architecture of **Maatify Admin Infra** is now:
- Fully defined
- Internally consistent
- Extensible
- Ready for implementation planning

---

## 🔜 Next Logical Steps (Optional)

- ADR Index (if needed)
- Implementation roadmap
- Test strategy blueprint
- Package splitting plan
