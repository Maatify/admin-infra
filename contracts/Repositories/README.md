# Repositories Contracts (Phase 2)

This directory is intentionally empty in Phase 1.

Repository contracts will be introduced in Phase 2, after:
- DTO-only contracts are finalized
- Core orchestration rules are defined

Scope of Phase 2 repositories:
- DTO-only signatures
- No arrays
- Explicit intent (Query vs Command)
- No infrastructure assumptions
